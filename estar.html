							</header>
							On this subsystem I worked on the <strong>software</strong> side:
							<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
								<li style="circle"><strong>Operative modes definition and implementation</strong>, including scheduling, mode switching from telecommands, management of the activated/deactivated equipments in each mode</li>
								<li style="circle"><strong>Telecommands implementation</strong>, both simple C&DH ones such as telemetry management, antenna deployment, mission time update, and so on, and cross-subsystem ones, such as telecommands for the ADCS, such as updating UTC time (used for the propagator), changing the torquers' polarity, and more.</li>
								<li style="circle">Implementation of functions to help during the <strong>ground tests</strong>, such has interfacing the C&DH with the USB port.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
							<strong>Things learned</strong>:<br>
							MSP430 architecture, SD, serial and USB interfaces, data driven telecommands and telemetry implementation, automated testing and testing procedures, low level programming such as pin commanding and reading, telemetry packet building, scheduling and real time operations (and threads, semaphores, custom libraries from the vendor).</br>

								<span class="byline">From component tests to algorithm implementation</span>

							<p>Regarding the ADCS of the two CubeSats, I participated in the design and development during the second CubeSat.</br>
							I was participating in several activities:
							<ul  style="list-style-type:circle">
								<li style="circle">IMU testing</li>
								<li style="circle">Magnetic torquers characterization and functional testing</li>
								<li style="circle">Development of complete flight code in C. Portions of it were realized with the participation of my colleague <a href="http://raffaelemozzillo.github.io/" target="_blank">Raffaele</a>.</li>
								<li style="circle">Definition of the high level architecture, and the interfaces between ADCS and C&DH systems.</li>
								<li style="circle">Algorithms development: B-dot control, Y-Thomson control</li>
								<li style="circle">Testing and verification of the implemented algorithm with comparisons with Matlab/Simulink code and STK simulations.</li>
								
							</ul>
							<strong>Things learned</strong>:<br>
							ARM v9 architecture, RT Linux, sensor characterization and functional testing (IMU), actuator functional testing (Magnetic torquers), code verification with STK (SGP4 propagator), magnetic field model implementation and verification via Matlab/Simulink, basics of Kalman Filtering, controls (B-Dot, Y-Thomson for detumbling), PWM control, IMU sampling (gyros, magnetometers) and more.<br><br>

							</header>
							<p>For e-st@r-II, it was adopted a mixture of document-based and SysML-based approaches.
							Here is a list of all the activities and documents I have dealt with at a system level:
							<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
								<li style="circle"><strong>CubeSat Design Description</strong>, it describes into the details the e-st@r-II CUbeSat, from the system point of view</li>
								<li style="circle"><strong>Environmental Test Plan</strong>, it aims at providing information about the planning of the environmental tests to be performed on e-st@r-II CubeSat. The document guides the developer through the definition of the vibration and thermal-vacuum tests, giving information about the GSE and test facilities to be used, the personnel, organisation and management of the environmental test campaign and its schedule</li>
								<li style="circle"><strong>Environmental Test Procedure</strong>, it aims at providing all the information required to fully define each test activity foreseen in Environmental Test Plan for the environmental test campaign. In particular, the requirements to be verified, the test approach and requirements for each related acitivity, the precise set-up, the GSE and pass/fail criteria for each test are described.</li>
								<li style="circle"><strong>FDS-VCD</strong>, it is the Verification Control Document for Fly Your Satellite! Design Specifications. It defines, in matrix form, for each requirement to be verified, the combination of the selected verification methods for the different verification levels at the applicable verification stages.</li>
								<li style="circle"><strong>Functional Test Reports</strong>. One for each basic and full functional test performed during Fly Your Satellite! programme. It derives the information contained in the Test Plan, Specification and Procedure document, and includes additional elements such as the completed as-run procedure.</li>
								<li style="circle"><strong>Memo</strong>, several memorandum were produced to provide to ESA specific information, ranging from info at component level up to system level, in a more concise way.</li>
								<li style="circle"><strong>Mission Description Document</strong>, it is aimed to describe the e-st@r-II mission. The purpose is to give a description of the mission, to provide input for the selection of the best architecture meeting the mission statement in iteration with the definition of the system specification. It presents how the objectives, operation profile, major system events and capabilities, contingencies and performance are expected to be achieved.The document structure goes through the definition of the mission requirements and mission architecture. Then a description of the mission scenario is provided, in terms of main mission phases, satellite operational modes, nominal orbit activities and contingencies, from the perspective of space and ground segments</li>
								<li style="circle"><strong>Mission Test Report</strong>, it is structured in a similar way to functional test reports, but it provides information about the mission test</li>
								<li style="circle"><strong>NCR</strong>, during the verification campaigns, several non-conformance occurred. A non-conformance report documents the details of a non-conformance identified in a quality audit or other process review. The objective of the report is to make an unambiguous, defensible, clear and concise definition of the problem so that corrective action can and will be initiated by management</li>
								<li style="circle"><strong>Request For Waiver</strong>, the objective of the RFW is to be the vehicle for requiring and agreeing to the use or the delivery of a product that does not conform to its approved product configuration baseline</li>
								<li style="circle"><strong>Review Item Discrepancy</strong>, more than 100 RIDs were created in FYS programme. RIDs are prepared to record identified problems and questions arising from the examination of the review documentation</li>
								<li style="circle"><strong>Space Debris Mitigation Report</strong>, it reports the assessments, justifications and verification of compliance with ESA requirements about space debris regulations</li>
								<li style="circle"><strong>SSD-VCD</strong>, it is the VCD for system specifications. It defines, in matrix form, for each requirement to be verified, the combination of the selected verification methods for the different verification levels at the applicable verification stages</li>
								<li style="circle"><strong>Test Report</strong>, several test reports were produced. They range from tests at component level up to system level. They include about the test set-up, GSE used, as-run procedures and result analysis</li>
							</ul>

								<span class="byline">In the loop simulations</span>
							</header>
							<p>I've worked to develop a Hardware-In-The-Loop simulator as my MSc thesis. The simulator was developed in Python (even though the flight code was in C) and included features as automatic code generation, simulation architecture selection (Algorithm-, Software-, Controller- and Hardware-In-The-Loop).
							The simulator was presented several congresses; download the most recent presentation <a href="Files/HITL.pptx">here</a>.<br><br>
							Additional activities:
							<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
								<li style="circle"><strong>Assembly and verification</strong> of e-st@r-II CubeSat</li>
								<li style="circle"><strong>Functional test campaign</strong> at Polito</li>
								<li style="circle"><strong>Integration campaign</strong> at CSG, Kourou, French Guiana</li>
